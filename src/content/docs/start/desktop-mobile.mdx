Tauri supports developing both desktop and mobile apps. Most aspects of developing an app for Tauri remain the same regardless of the platforms you target.

## Platform-specific differences

As you follow along in the guide, we will point out locations where usage may differ. E.g. there is some [mobile-specific setup](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/#configure-for-mobile-targets), you will run different commands to run your application when you [develop for mobile vs desktop](https://v2.tauri.app/develop/), and of course these applications will be [distributed in different ways](https://v2.tauri.app/distribute/). Finally, note that [many plugins are supported for specific platforms](https://v2.tauri.app/plugin/#support-table).
